# This is the README.md file for Lab 4 of the COEN 178 Intro to Databases course

Objectives: Learn
SQL Integrity Constraints
PLSQL Procedures and cursors.
SQL random number generator

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this lab, we will create two new tables and load them with data from staff_2010 table that you have created in the earlier labs. 	
The following is the plan of what you will do today.
a) Create two new tables with foreign key constraints
b) Load the new tables with a subset of data from staff_2010 table (we will avoid the tedium of having to load them by hand with hardcoded values)
c) Test the referential integrity enforcement.
d) Write PLSQL procedures to insert values for salary using a random number generator (this will come in handy if you want to generate “fake values” for demo purposes).

# This is the README.md file for Lab 5 of COEN 178 Intro to Databases Course

##Objectives: Learn 

• PLSQL Functions\
• PLSQL Triggers\

In this lab, we will use AlphaCoEmp and Emp_Work tables that you have created in the earlier labs. You may need to create 2 new tables as we follow through the questions. 

The following is the plan of what you will do today.\
a) Load randomly generated values for salary and title for the tuples in AlphaCoEmp using a procedure.\
b) Write a function called calcSalaryRaise() to calculate the amount of raise for an employee.\
c) Create a table called EmpStats.\
d) Create a procedure called saveCountsByTitle\
e) Create a function called countByTitle()\
f) Write a trigger to change the count by title\ 

Run the queries and capture the results in lab5_output.lst, using spool.

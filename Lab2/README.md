# Lab 2

This is the README.md file for Lab 2 of the COEN 178 Intro to Databases Lab course. In the first part of the lab, I wrote SQL queries by using Orderby, aggregate functions, and joining tables. To start, I created some tables and input some data into them by using the queries that I used from the last Lab, including CREATE, INSERT, and SELECT.

In part two, I used multiple SQL queries in order to obtain the information from the tables according to the specific given conditions. In this part of the lab, I used functions like ORDER BY, count(), and group by () in order to obtain only the data that matches the requirements given.

In part 3, I created two tables L_EMP and L_DEPT, and inserted some tuples into them. I then used the SELECT command to find the names of the employees that match the conditions required by the lab.
